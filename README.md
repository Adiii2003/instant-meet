## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adiii2003/instant-meet.git
   cd instant-meet
Open in browser
Just double-click web.html in any modern browser.

Allow Permissions
Grant access to camera and microphone when prompted.

📖 How It Works
User opens the web.html file in a browser.

The app requests camera and microphone permissions.

WebRTC captures media streams (audio + video).

A peer-to-peer connection is established between participants.

Streams are exchanged, enabling a smooth real-time video call.

🔮 Future Improvements
✅ Integrated text chat alongside video calls

✅ Group video conferencing support

✅ Dedicated signaling server for multiple users

✅ Authentication & private meeting rooms
