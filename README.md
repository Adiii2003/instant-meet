⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Adiii2003/instant-meet.git
cd instant-meet


Open in Browser
Simply open the web.html file in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

Grant Permissions
Allow browser permissions for camera and microphone when prompted.

📖 How It Works

When you open web.html, the app will request access to your camera and microphone.

Using WebRTC APIs, your media streams (audio + video) are captured.

The app establishes a peer-to-peer connection between participants.

Streams are exchanged, enabling real-time video/audio calling.

🔮 Future Improvements

✅ Add chat feature alongside video call

✅ Implement group video calling

✅ Deploy signaling server for multi-user support

✅ Add authentication and private meeting rooms
